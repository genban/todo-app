# todo-app

the world's most scalable to-do list!

this is mostly a tech exercise in integrating:

- scalajs
- akka-http
- react
- cassandra

as a full stack with all the things you'd expect from in a micro-service architecture.

## setup

```sh
brew install cassandra
```

## running

### one terminal

start cassandra 

```sh
cassandra
```

### another terminal

```sh
sbt ~reStart
```
